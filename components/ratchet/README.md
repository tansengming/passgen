# Ratchet

Prototype mobile apps with simple HTML, CSS and JS components.

## Getting Started

- Clone the repo `git clone git@github.com:maker/ratchet.git` or just [download]() the bundled CSS and JS
- [Read the docs](http://maker.github.com/ratchet) to learn about the components and how to get a prototype on your phone
- We will have example apps to check out very soon!

## Support

Ratchet was developed to support iOS 5+ for iPhone. Questions or discussions about Ratchet should happen in the [Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/goratchet) or hit us up on Twitter [@goRatchet](http://www.twitter.com/goratchet).

## Future features

Ratchet is just getting started. Here are some of the immediate features we're thinking about:

- Shelf (exposable left hand navigation a la Path or Facebook)
- Gridviews
- Notifications
- Slide control
- More list views options
- Improved active states (especially for lists)
- Docking list dividers
- Touch library for richer touch events (swipes, long press, etc)
- Autocomplete
- Hiding title bar (hides with scroll)

Even these are just the short-term goals though. We eventually want to extend Ratchet beyond the prototying for iPhone and create HTML/CSS/JS components for iPad and Android devices. Our dream is that Ratchet becomes the best way to create mobile experiences with web standard languages.
