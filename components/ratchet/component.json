  "readme": "# Ratchet\n\nPrototype mobile apps with simple HTML, CSS and JS components.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n- Clone the repo `git clone git@github.com:maker/ratchet.git` or just [download]() the bundled CSS and JS\n- [Read the docs](http://maker.github.com/ratchet) to learn about the components and how to get a prototype on your phone\n- We will have example apps to check out very soon!\n\n## Support\n\nRatchet was developed to support iOS 5+ for iPhone. Questions or discussions about Ratchet should happen in the [Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/goratchet) or hit us up on Twitter [@goRatchet](http://www.twitter.com/goratchet).\n\n## Reporting bugs & contributing\n\nPlease file a Github issue to [report a bug](http://github.com/maker/ratchet/issues). When reporting a bug, be sure to follow the [contributor guidelines](https://github.com/maker/ratchet/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## Future features\n\nRatchet is just getting started. Here are some of the immediate features we're thinking about:\n\n- Shelf (exposable left hand navigation a la Path or Facebook)\n- Gridviews\n- Notifications\n- Slide control\n- More list views options\n- Improved active states (especially for lists)\n- Docking list dividers\n- Touch library for richer touch events (swipes, long press, etc)\n- Autocomplete\n- Hiding title bar (hides with scroll)\n\nEven these are just the short-term goals though. We eventually want to extend Ratchet beyond the prototying for iPhone and create HTML/CSS/JS components for iPad and Android devices. Our dream is that Ratchet becomes the best way to create mobile experiences with web standard languages.\n\n## Authors\n\nDave Gamache\n\n- http://twitter.com/dhg\n- http://github.com/dhgamache\n\nConnor Sears\n\n- http://twitter.com/connors\n- http://github.com/connors\n\nJacob Thornton\n\n- http://twitter.com/fat\n- http://github.com/fat\n\n\n## License\n\nRatchet is licensed under the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).",
